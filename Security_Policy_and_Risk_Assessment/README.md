# Security Policy and Risk Assessment

## Goal
Draft simple security policies and perform a basic risk assessment.  
This helped me think about security beyond tools — focusing on people and processes.

## Steps I Took
1. Listed assets (data, systems, accounts) and possible threats
2. Built a simple risk matrix (likelihood x impact)
3. Wrote mock policies for topics like access control and data handling
4. Suggested mitigations (strong passwords, 2FA, backups, awareness training)
5. Documented risks that couldn’t be eliminated but could be reduced

## Tools Used
- Risk matrix templates
- Policy writing (plain language drafts)

## What I Learned
- How policies shape human behavior in security
- Why documenting risks helps decision-makers prioritize
- The balance between realistic risks and overkill controls
