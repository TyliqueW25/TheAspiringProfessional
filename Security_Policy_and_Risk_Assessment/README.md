# Security Policy and Risk Assessment

## Goal
Draft basic security policies and assess risks.  

## Steps I Took
- Listed key assets and threats
- Built a simple risk matrix
- Wrote mock policies for access & data handling
- Suggested mitigations (passwords, 2FA, backups)
- Noted risks that can’t be fully fixed

## Tools Used
- Risk matrices
- Policy templates

## What I Learned
- Policies guide people’s behavior
- Documenting risks helps decision-making
- Security is as much about people as tools
