# Incident Response Simulation

## Goal
Work through a staged incident from start to finish.  
This was about practicing the full cycle â€” detection, analysis, containment, and documenting everything like I would in a real SOC.

## Steps I Took
1. Started with suspicious log entries that hinted at brute force attempts
2. Confirmed unusual activity by checking failed logins and strange processes
3. Looked up IP addresses against known bad sources
4. Contained the incident by isolating the machine from the network
5. Gathered forensic evidence (logs, process lists, timestamps)
6. Created a timeline of what happened and how I responded
7. Wrote a short after-action report

## Tools Used
- Linux command line (grep, netstat, ps)
- Log files (auth.log, syslog)
- WHOIS and threat intel lookups

## What I Learned
- How to work through an incident systematically instead of guessing
- The importance of speed when containing threats
- Why documenting every action matters for teams and audits
