# Incident Response Simulation

## Goal
Work through a mock security incident from detection to containment.

## Steps I Took
1. Collected logs from the affected system
2. Identified suspicious IP traffic and processes
3. Contained the threat by isolating the machine
4. Documented findings and drafted a response summary

## Tools Used
- Linux command line
- Log files
- Basic forensics techniques

## What I Learned
- How to spot unusual activity in logs
- Why documenting each action matters
- The importance of quick containment
