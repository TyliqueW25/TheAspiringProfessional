# Incident Response Simulation 🔐

## Background
For this scenario, I walked through how I would handle a workstation sending out suspicious outbound traffic. I’m still early in my journey, but I wanted to practice what I’ve learned so far — spotting a problem, breaking it down, and thinking through the steps I’d take to respond.  

---

## Tools I Used
- **Linux command line** – to look at files and logs  
- **Wireshark** – to see the network traffic  
- **Splunk** – to search through logs in a clear way

## Steps I Took

### Step 1: Contain the Issue  
The first thing I thought about was how to stop the problem from getting worse. In this case, I would isolate the computer from the network so no more data could leave.

### Step 2: Look at the Logs  
Next, I used what I’ve learned so far about logs and risk to check if there were unusual connections or IP addresses. This is part of availability and integrity from the CIA triad — making sure the system isn’t being misused.

### Step 3: Analyze Network Traffic  
Then I opened Wireshark to dig deeper into the traffic. By looking at the packets, I could see if the workstation was sending data to a suspicious external server.

### Step 4: Document Everything  
Finally, I documented my findings. Writing down what I saw, the steps I took, and possible risks is part of building a good security process and ties into defense-in-depth.

## Findings
- I noticed outbound traffic going to a suspicious external IP.  
- Based on what I’ve learned so far, this could be a vulnerability being taken advantage of or even early signs of malware.

## What I Learned
This exercise helped me apply what I know from the first modules of the Google Cybersecurity Certificate:  
- The CIA triad matters in every decision (I wanted to keep the system’s integrity and availability safe).  
- Thinking about threats and vulnerabilities helps me figure out what’s really happening.  
- Using tools like Linux, Wireshark, and Splunk makes it easier to investigate step by step.  
- Defense-in-depth means responding isn’t just one step — it’s a layered process.
