# Phishing Email Analysis

## Goal
Break down a phishing email and spot the red flags.  

## Steps I Took
- Opened the raw email headers
- Checked sender vs return-path
- Hovered links and looked for sketchy URLs
- Tested attachment in a sandbox
- Wrote down all red flags

## Tools Used
- Header analyzers
- Sandbox VM
- WHOIS and URL lookup

## What I Learned
- How attackers spoof addresses
- Common phishing tricks (urgency, fake logos)
- Training users matters just as much as tech
