# Cybersecurity Practice Scenarios üõ°Ô∏è

These are extra scenarios I worked on after finishing my Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate.  
The goal is simple: push myself, explore new tools, and keep a record of what I learn. This is all me vs me.

## Scenarios

### [Incident Response Simulation](./Incident_Response_Simulation)

- **Focus**: Handling a test security incident from detection to containment.
- **Tools/Notes**: Logs, basic forensics.

## How This Branch Works

- Each scenario has its own folder with a `README.md` inside.
- Inside the `README.md`: steps I followed, screenshots, what I learned.
- Extra files might include logs, scripts, or configs I used while experimenting.

## Notes

- All work is practice done in safe, isolated environments.
- No production data or sensitive info is included.
- This is just for me to track progress, see what works, and what I can do better.
