# Cybersecurity Scenarios 🛡️

This branch is where I’m building and sharing the scenarios I’ve created while working through the **Google Cybersecurity Certificate** and my own practice labs.  

Each scenario is meant to show how I think through problems, use different tools, and apply the knowledge I’ve been learning. I write them in my own words so they feel real, and I include steps, screenshots, and takeaways for each one.  

## 🔗 Scenarios
- [Incident Response Simulation](./IncidentResponse/README.md)  
- [Phishing Email Analysis](./PhishingAnalysis/README.md)  
- [Log Analysis with Splunk](./LogAnalysis/README.md)  
- [Vulnerability Assessment](./VulnerabilityAssessment/README.md)  
- [Security Policy & Risk Assessment](./SecurityPolicy/README.md)  

I’ll keep adding more scenarios here as I move through the program and gain more experience.
