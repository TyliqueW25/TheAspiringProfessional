## ðŸ‘‹ About Me
My name is **Tylique Walters**, and Iâ€™m working toward a career in cybersecurity because Iâ€™ve always had a strong connection with technology and a genuine interest in how systems workâ€”and how they can be protected. Iâ€™ve been using computers since middle school, and over time Iâ€™ve become really comfortable navigating different systems and solving technical problems on my own.  

One of my biggest strengths is **critical thinking**. I enjoy digging into complex issues, breaking them down, and figuring out how to solve them. That curiosity and problem-solving mindset is what led me to cybersecurity.  

I recently started the **Google Cybersecurity Certificate program** to build up my skills and get real, hands-on experience. So far, Iâ€™ve worked through the first four modules, where Iâ€™ve learned:  
- The importance of the **CIA triad** (confidentiality, integrity, availability) in protecting information.  
- How to identify different types of **threats, vulnerabilities, and risks**, and the motivations behind attacks like phishing and social engineering.  
- How to use technical tools like the **Linux command line, SQL, and Python** to solve problems and analyze data.  
- The role of security **frameworks** like NIST and ISO, and how concepts like **defense in depth** and layered controls help protect systems.  

These modules have already given me a strong foundation to build on, and Iâ€™m excited to keep applying what I learn through hands-on labs and personal projects.
