# Cybersecurity Practice Scenarios 🛡️

These are extra scenarios I worked on after completing the Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate.  
The goal: push myself, explore new tools, and document what I learn along the way — a personal record of “me vs. me.”

## 📂 Scenarios

| Scenario | Focus | Tools / Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Incident Response Simulation** | Handling a mock security incident start to finish | Logs, basic forensics |
| **Phishing Email Analysis** | Breaking down a phishing attempt and spotting indicators | Email headers, payloads |
| **Log Analysis with Splunk** | Finding anomalies in log data | Splunk dashboards, SPL queries |
| **Vulnerability Assessment** | Reviewing scan results and planning remediation | Nessus/OpenVAS, CVSS |
| **Security Policy & Risk Assessment** | Drafting mock policies and prioritizing risks | Risk matrices, policy templates |

## 🔧 How This Branch Works

- Each scenario has a folder with a `README.md`  
- Inside: steps I followed, screenshots, notes on what I learned  
- Extra files: logs, scripts, or configs used for experimentation

## 📌 Notes

- All work is practice in safe, isolated environments  
- No production data or sensitive info included  
- This is purely for personal growth a record of how I shall push myself beyond the certificate
