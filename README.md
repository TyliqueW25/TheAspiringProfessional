# TheAspiringProfessional
My name is Tylique Walters, and I’m working toward a career in cybersecurity because I’ve always had a strong connection with technology and a genuine interest in how systems work—and how they can be protected. I’ve been using computers since middle school, and over time I’ve become really comfortable navigating different systems and solving technical problems on my own.

One of my biggest strengths is critical thinking. I like digging into complex issues, breaking them down, and figuring out how to solve them. That curiosity and problem-solving mindset is what led me to cybersecurity. I recently started the Google Cybersecurity Certificate program to build up my skills and get real, hands-on experience. I’m excited to take what I’ve learned and apply it in the real world—especially in a role where I can keep learning and help protect people and organizations from digital threats.
