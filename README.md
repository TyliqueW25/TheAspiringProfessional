# Cybersecurity Practice Scenarios üõ°Ô∏è

These are extra scenarios I worked on after finishing my Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate  
The goal is simple push myself explore new tools and keep a record of what I learn this is all me vs me

## Scenarios

| Scenario | Focus | Tools or Notes |
| Scenario | Focus | Tools or Notes |
| [Incident Response Simulation](./Incident_Response_Simulation) | handling a mock security incident start to finish | logs basic forensics |
| [Phishing Email Analysis](./Phishing_Email_Analysis) | breaking down a phishing attempt and spotting indicators | email headers payloads |
| [Log Analysis with Splunk](./Log_Analysis_with_Splunk) | finding anomalies in log data | splunk dashboards spl queries |
| [Vulnerability Assessment](./Vulnerability_Assessment) | reviewing scan results and planning remediation | nessus openvas cvss |
| [Security Policy & Risk Assessment](./Security_Policy_and_Risk_Assessment) | drafting mock policies and prioritizing risks | risk matrices policy templates |

## How This Branch Works

Each scenario has its own folder with a readme inside  
Inside the readme i write the steps i followed screenshots what i learned  
Extra files might include logs scripts or configs i used while experimenting  

## Notes

All work is practice done in safe isolated environments  
No production data or sensitive info is included  
This is just for me to track progress see what works and what i can do better
