# TheAspiringProfessional
My name is Tylique Walters, and I’m working toward a career in cybersecurity because I’m passionate about protecting people and their information in the digital world. I’ve always been drawn to technology and enjoy taking on challenges that require problem-solving and critical thinking. Even though I’m just getting started in the field, I’m eager to learn and grow. I’m currently completing the Google Cybersecurity Certificate to build a strong foundation and gain the practical skills I need to succeed. I’m excited to start this journey and contribute to a field that’s all about staying ahead of threats and helping others stay safe online.
