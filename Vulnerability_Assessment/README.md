# Vulnerability Assessment

## Goal
Run a vulnerability scan, interpret the results, and suggest fixes.  
This simulated how real teams prioritize weaknesses in their environment.

## Steps I Took
1. Ran a scan on a test machine with Nessus/OpenVAS
2. Exported the results and sorted findings by severity
3. Reviewed CVSS scores to decide what to patch first
4. Checked vendor advisories for available patches
5. Built a remediation plan that balanced quick wins and long-term fixes

## Tools Used
- Nessus / OpenVAS
- CVSS scoring system
- Vendor advisories and patch notes

## What I Learned
- Not every high number matters â€” context is key
- How to balance urgent patches with business needs
- The importance of documenting remediation steps
