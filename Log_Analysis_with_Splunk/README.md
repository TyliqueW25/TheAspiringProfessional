# Log Analysis with Splunk

## Goal
Use Splunk to dig into log data and spot anomalies that might signal a security issue.  
This helped me practice filtering noise and focusing on meaningful signals.

## Steps I Took
1. Ingested server and firewall logs into Splunk
2. Built a dashboard that tracked login attempts by location and user
3. Wrote SPL queries to detect repeated failed logins and odd login times
4. Flagged traffic from unusual IP ranges
5. Saved search results and documented findings in a summary report

## Tools Used
- Splunk dashboards
- SPL queries
- Sample log datasets

## What I Learned
- How visualization makes hidden activity stand out
- SPL basics for filtering and pattern recognition
- Why logs are one of the best sources for early detection
