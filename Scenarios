# Cybersecurity Scenarios 🛡️

Each scenario is meant to show how I think through problems, use different tools, and apply the knowledge I’ve been learning. I include steps, screenshots, and takeaways for each one.  

## 🔗 Scenarios
- [Incident Response Simulation](./IncidentResponse/README.md)  
- [Phishing Email Analysis](./PhishingAnalysis/README.md)  
- [Log Analysis with Splunk](./LogAnalysis/README.md)  
- [Vulnerability Assessment](./VulnerabilityAssessment/README.md)  
- [Security Policy & Risk Assessment](./SecurityPolicy/README.md)  

I’ll keep adding more scenarios here as I move through the program and gain more experience.
